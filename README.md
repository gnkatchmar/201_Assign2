Assignment for Class
Today we will be expanding our javascript to include functions so that we can execute code blocks more logically, and later on, in a more controlled manner.

Submit Your Work

User Stories (MVP)

As a developer, I want my code written in a modular way, so that I can reuse functionality without duplicating code.
As a developer, I want my user to see the answers and responses on the web page, so we do not have to constantly interact with alerts.
Technical Requirements

Updated and cleanly documented README
Game functionality is encapsulated in functions
Alerts have been removed from the game, and replaced by printing answers to the DOM.
User Stories (Stretch)

As a developer, I want to add a sixth question to my game, which has multiple possible answers (hint: using an array and for loop)
As a developer, I want to add some basic styling to my site, so that I can increase the happiness and engagement of my users (hint: do not use inline styling for this; you should link to another file for your styling)
